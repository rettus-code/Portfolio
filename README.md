# Responsive-Portfolio
# About me/ Home page
I knew this was going to be the most time consuming. As the starting point it would be the basis of styling setup for my navbar 
and being the first thing anyone sees should definitely be complete. It was a great time to practice some of the new bootstrap 
techniques I had learned. I always wanted to keep it pretty simple, don't want to overwhelm anyone right away and also give me some 
to work with where I wouldn't feel like restarting the entire page. 

The navbar was pulled from bootstrap then edited for my needs.
# header
I pulled a new font from google that seems a bit out of place but is really perfect for me, just a touch of metal behind all that business.
This is the only spot I used the media query was with the hr tag since it doesn't scale with the other elements across platforms.

I'm not fully set on the menger cube, so it's a bit of a placeholder, but i do like the image of building from an existing pattern.
# personal touch
It's an about me page so this is where I let them know who I am over the years this will change, but I tend to like showing things in
that order, who I was, who I am, and who I'm going to be. I used bootstrap cards here along with a grid to place everything and allow 
it to be responsive.

# Portfolio
An easy copy and paste for the header and navbar so from the hr tag and up it's functionally the same.

Not really having a portfolio yet I linked two projects I did last Summer after learning a bit from Khan Academy. They don't do well
on mobile platforms, though I intend to go back and fix that. It will be great practice. The third was something we started in class
that I decided to expand upon, it too needs some work for mobile users but bootstrap will be used in short order. I discvered an issue
with URL links and safari. One of the URLs has capital letters and safari wouldn't load it until i typed it out the same way.

# Contact
Again the same setup for header

I ony used 1 row and column for the contact links, the rest is a form from bootstrap I edited a little.
